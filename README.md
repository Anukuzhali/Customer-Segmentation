# Customer-Segmentation

•	A big-name retailer or a small store, understanding the outside market and customer is an important part of running a successful retail store.
•	Customers are individuals, each with individual needs and interests. Approaching them as individuals will vastly aid your marketing efforts and increase customer loyalty to your business.
•	Through segmentation you can create groups of customers with similar qualities and tailor your communications in a personalized manner.
•	Segmentation is an absolute must for any business that wants to improve its marketing and develop closer relationships with customers.
As a part of Retail customer segmentation we are splitting the xustomers into high medum and low value based on their recency(no of days before they visted), frequency of purchase and monetary value of their purchase.
We have also used K Means clustering to group customers
